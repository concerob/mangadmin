    .guild invite
    .guild rank
    .guild delete
    .tele add
    .tele del
    .tele group
    .tele name
    .mute
    Note: Tooltops on each button give the syntax of the parameters the user needs to type in the editbox.
  * Changed wording on the Move Random and Move Waypoint buttons to make the text fit.


Rev. 107:
  * Added Jails group and 3 teles to Teleport table
  * Added SetJail (A) and SetJail (H) commands to Main tab
  * Added a target editbox and Jail (A), Jail (H), and UnJail commands to Character tab.
  * The above changes allow use of a Jail/UnJail system *without* having to have the Jail patch compiled into ManGos. 
    To use: Teleport to wherever you want the alliance Jail to be (or use the tele I supplied). Once there,
    click the Main tab, then click the SetJail A button. This creates a tele location that will be used as a tele 
    target for Jailing. Teleport to a good location for a Horde Jail (or use the supplied tele, repeat steps 
    for setting the Horde Jail (using the SetJail H button).
    To send a character to jail, open the Character tab, type the character's name in the editbox, then click 
    the Jail A or Jail H button to send the character to jail. Withthe character's name in the editbox, clicking
    the UnJail button will do a .recall on the character, sending them back where they were before the last teleport.
    Caveats: In order to execute multiple commands in one function, I had to put a delay between each command. I did
    it sloppily.. you will note your character saying some odd things to waste time between commands. When I have 
    a more elegant way of implementing a delay, I will add it. Also, be aware that sending a character to jail 
    does NOT prevent them from hearthing back out... may or may not be addressed in the future.
  * The target editbox will be used for future commands which require a name 
    (as opposed to commands which act on the targeted creature). Will look into automatically filling the 
    editbox with a name when a character is targeted.


Rev. 106: 
  * Added 'cooldown' command to Character tab.
  * Added 'demorph' command to Character tab.
  * Added 'show maps' command (.explorecheat 1) to Character tab
  * Added 'hide maps' command (.explorecheat 0) to Character tab

      the functinality of the links completely

Rev. 101:
  * added filtering of chat messages to the ticket system, so no chat messages get caught when
    loading tickets
  
Rev. 100:

    big part of the patch by infamousblob. Need translators.
    If you have an english mangos_string table (which means that you have no text in any content_loc* column)
    you have nothing to do.
    Else go into the Misc section and check the checkbutton labeled "Enable Localized Search Strings",
    then click the "apply changes" button...
    This will only work with German and English because these are the only one who are translated so far...
    So translators please take a look at the Locale/strings.lua file :-)

    but I don't know who provided them atm

Rev. 6:
  * few changes to translations
  * removed MaNGOS .togglegm patch from Rev. 4 because it was rejected and won't be applied to 
    MaNGOS svn, for details look here: http://www.mangosproject.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=13397
  * fixed few typos
  * partly implemented language switcher, not yet usable
  * restructuring, optimizing and commenting of nearly all code in MangAdmin.lua
  * added hooking function: GetValueCallHandler
  * added function ordering list, to garantee that functions added in the future, 
    using the same .getvalue request are handled in the right order
  * sorry the fly mode button does only deactivate fly mode if you are flying, this will be fixed later
  * there are several optimization changes todo before I can start implementing real usable ingame functions,
    so please be patient! ty

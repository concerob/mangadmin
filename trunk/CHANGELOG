=CHANGELOG= 
Rev. 27:
  * applied french language update with fixed chars, thanks to Ancient
  * implement show bytes left on mail sending, because mail will be cut if using more...
  * changed default entry for mail subject when answering ticket to subject: "Ticket(catnr)"

  * applied czech language update, thanks to Yas (http://forsan.eu)
  * applied romanian language update, thanks to x_ray
  * fixed bug: not loading tickets with special-chars in owners name, thanks to galeane for reporting
    problem: I can't create a character with special-chars, but I think it's fixed now, need confirmation
  * now really added a direct-whisper button to the ticket tab (forgot in last revision)
  * added a style changer for color and transparency, located in misc section. 
    Changing colors can be really funny but also ugly :)
  * ordered language dropdown in alphabetical way

Rev. 25:
  * applied german language update, thanks to hArD kNoCkZ
  * applied full translated french, thanks to Ancient
  * added a new icon that only shows up when your getting new tickets
  * added a button to the ticket-system to directly whisper a player
  * fixed a bug: when switching from the ticket-load popup to another popup the tickets were still shown
  * fixed the language files: my damn editor put "ï»¿" in the beginning of each file I saved...
  * added an option to put transparency on or off. To do so type this: "/mangadmin transparency"
  * for the next revision I'll try to add a style switcher (also to choose colors and other things)

Rev. 24:
  * weekend update=> whole ticket-system rewritten:
    * ticket-loading is now separated in 7 tickets/click (no fighting against MaNGOS spamfilter anymore)
    * when getting a new ticket, there will be a sound + information regarding the newest tickets
      in the icon tooltip, by clicking on it you can quicklaunch the ticket-tab or teleport the the player
    * when loading a ticket, there will automatically informations about the player who created 
      the ticket are loaded. The informations are shown at the right side of the ticket text 
      instead of the old ticket listing. The new ticket list opens in a popup...
    * there is a little bug left: When MangAdmin is activated you won't get ticket information
      per chat anymore because MangAdmin will eat it. This bug will be fixed in next rev... I'm too tired atm
  * in the server tab the graph shows the lag instead of the FPS, in next revision I want the graph to show
    four things in the same time: lag, up, down and FPS
  * localisations of all shown text have been added to the translations files,
    this means that the translators have some work now :-)
  * small code cleanup
  
Rev. 23:
  * added a send mail function to MangAdmin, 
    please remember not to use spaces in recipient and subject names
  * next time I'll updates the language files, atm it's a bit messy
  * now if you click on the answer-button of the ticket-system,
    a popup opens ans you'll be able to write cool answers
  * replaced the ToggleSearchPopup() function with an easier and more simple function TogglePopup(). 
    This function will handle _all_ popup calls and not just the search popups

  * I just decided to write more details to the changelog in the future...

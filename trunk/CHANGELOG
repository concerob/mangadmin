Rev. 8:
  - little fix: added DewDrop-2.0
  - little fix: downgraded all ace libs to fit interface version 20003 (2.0.12),
    there shouldn't popup any ace errors anymore (!)otherwise please tell me
  - added a speed-slider and two buttons (that do nothing so far)
  
Rev. 7:
  - few bugs fixed
  - moved MangFrames code into MangAdmin.lua to make the code more handy
  - flymode button defect, need to know getvalue of PLAYER_MOVEMENT_FLAGS, if exists
  - finally implemented language switcher, now translators can test their translations!
  
Rev. 6:
  - few changes to translations
  - removed MaNGOS .togglegm patch from Rev. 4 because it was rejected and won't be applied to MaNGOS svn,
    for details look here: http://www.mangosproject.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=13397
  - fixed few typos
  - partly implemented language switcher, not yet usable
  - restructuring, optimizing and commenting of nearly all code in MangAdmin.lua
  - added hooking function: GetValueCallHandler
  - added function ordering list, to garantee that functions added in the future, 
    using the same .getvalue request are handled in the right order
  - sorry the fly mode button does only deactivate fly mode if you are flying, this will be fixed later
  - there are several optimization changes todo before I can start implementing real usable ingame functions,
    so please be patient! ty

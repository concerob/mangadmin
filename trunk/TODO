    =Suggestions by Yas=
      Next, i have a few suggestions - Bookmark system of favourite items, itemsets, teleports, spells etc could be very usefull.
      - Field for morph command, combined with bookmarks can be usefull too (at least for me :-)
      - New window with informations about targetted object (by .targetobject) and with button to delete/move..
      - Window like Who List but with simplier filtering of players, teleporting, (mass teleporting?), mailing...
      - Minimalize option with shortcuts to sections like mangadmin for 1.12

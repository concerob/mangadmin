=Suggestions by Yas (Quote)=
  - Field for morph command, combined with bookmarks can be usefull too (at least for me :-)
  - New window with informations about targetted object (by .targetobject) and with button to delete/move..
  - Window like Who List but with simplier filtering of players, teleporting, (mass teleporting?), mailing...
  - Minimalize option with shortcuts to sections like mangadmin for 1.12
      
==What is coming next:==
  * add a function to exchange favorites with each other (synchronization) or simply send own
    favorites to other player, favorites can also be exported or imported
  *

  - Field for morph command, combined with bookmarks can be usefull too (at least for me :-)
  - New window with informations about targetted object (by .targetobject) and with button to delete/move..
  - Window like Who List but with simplier filtering of players, teleporting, (mass teleporting?), mailing...

  It would be great to have a remove res sickness button (.unaura 15007)

==What should come next:==
  * add a function to exchange favorites with each other (synchronization) or simply send own
    favorites to other player, favorites can also be exported or imported
  * fix: correct some coordinates in MangFrames_Start.lua, this prevents layout boxes to
    float between good and bod positions when using /rl often
  * add: waypoint action buttons
  * move unlocalizable strings from core or frame code to locale files
  * add icon preview for item search (this can be implemented since item icon informations
    are stored by client)
